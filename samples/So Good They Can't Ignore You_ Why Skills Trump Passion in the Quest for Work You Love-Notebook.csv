"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 127","","The narratives in this book are bound by a common thread: the importance of ability."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 128","","The things that make a great job great, I discovered, are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 129","","In other words, you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 142","","move his focus away from finding the right work and toward working right,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 235","","Perhaps the only thing it does make clear is that, at least for Jobs, “follow your passion” was not particularly useful advice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 250","","Glass emphasizes that it takes time to get good at anything, recounting the many years it took him to master radio to the point where he had interesting options."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 251","","“The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that’s the hardest phase,”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 266","","Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 290","","A job, in Wrzesniewski’s formulation, is a way to pay the bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that’s an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 299","","it seems that the type of work alone does not necessarily predict how much people enjoy it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 305","","the more experience an assistant had, the more likely she was to love her work."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 306","","the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 311","","Conclusion #3: Passion Is a Side Effect of Mastery"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 316","","Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which is arguably the best understanding science currently has for why some pursuits get our engines running while others leave us cold."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 317","","SDT tells us that motivation, in the workplace or elsewhere, requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs—factors described as the “nutriments” required to feel intrinsically motivated for your work: Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 329","","Competence and autonomy, for example, are achievable by most people in a wide variety of jobs—assuming they’re willing to put in the hard work required for mastery."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 331","","In other words, working right trumps finding the right work."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 358","","passion hypothesis convinces people that somewhere there’s a magic “right” job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they’ll immediately recognize that this is the work they were meant to do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 359","","The problem, of course, is when they fail to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job-hopping and crippling self-doubt."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 369","","The more we focused on loving what we do, the less we ended up loving it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 404","","RULE #2   Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 410","","two different approaches to thinking about work: the craftsman mindset, a focus on what value you’re producing in your job, and the passion mindset, a focus on what value your job offers you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 411","","Most people adopt the passion mindset,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 461","","“Nobody ever takes note of [my advice], because it’s not the answer they wanted to hear,” Martin said. “What they want to hear is ‘Here’s how you get an agent, here’s how you write a script,’… but I always say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore you.’ ”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 463","","“If somebody’s thinking, ‘How can I be really good?’ people are going to come to you.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 472","","It took Martin, by his own estimation, ten years for his new act to cohere, but when it did, he became a monster success."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 474","","“[Eventually] you are so experienced [that] there’s a confidence that comes out,” Martin explained. “I think it’s something the audience smells.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 483","","track the hours spent each month dedicated to thinking hard about research problems"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 493","","“Here’s what I respect: creating something meaningful and then presenting it to the world,”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 503","","Irrespective of what type of work you do, the craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 509","","the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 528","","I am suggesting that you put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 530","","regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 550","","regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you’ll build a compelling career."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 575","","Most jobs don’t offer their employees great creativity, impact, or control over what they do and how they do it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 578","","Basic economic theory tells us that if you want something that’s both rare and valuable, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return—this is Supply and Demand 101. It follows that if you want a great job, you need something of great value to offer in return."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 596","","Glass began to break away from the pack when he turned his focus on making his skills more rare and more valuable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 622","","The traits that define great work are rare and valuable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 623","","Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 624","","Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 625","","The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 629","","The traits that define great work require that you have something rare and valuable to offer in return—skills I call career capital."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 633","","You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the craftsman mindset is focused on achieving exactly this goal."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 713","","it became clear to me that certain jobs are better suited for applying career capital theory than others."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 714","","ended up devising a list of three traits that disqualify a job as providing a good foundation for building work you love:"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 718","Y","The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 801","","It didn’t take long for Alex to discover what allows some writers to succeed in catching the attention of a network while so many others fail: They write good scripts—a"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 803","","During the eight months he spent as an assistant he dedicated his nights to working on a trio of different writing projects."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 897","","Mike literally tracks every hour of his day, down to quarter-hour increments, on a spreadsheet. He wants to ensure that his attention is focused on the activities that matter."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 920","","seriously for the same amount of time, did I end up an average high school strummer while Jordan became a star?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 922","","The difference in our abilities by the age of eighteen had less to do with the number of hours we practiced—though"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 924","","my discomfort playing anything I didn’t know real well."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 934","","Not only did Jordan’s early practice require him to constantly stretch himself beyond what was comfortable, but it was also accompanied by instant feedback."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 940","","This, then, explains why Jordan left me in the dust. I played. But he practiced."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 944","","can’t avoid the need to “go out to the woodshed in order to practice.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 992","","Hours spent in serious study of the game was not just the most important factor in predicting chess skill, it dominated the other factors."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 993","","The researchers discovered that the players who became grand masters spent five times more hours dedicated to serious study than those who plateaued at an intermediate level."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1002","","The “serious study” employed by top chess players sounds similar to Jordan Tice’s approach to music: They’re both focused on difficult activities, carefully chosen to stretch your abilities where they most need stretching and that provide immediate feedback."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1008","","“deliberate practice” to describe this style of serious study, defining it formally as an “activity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1021","","It is a lifetime accumulation of deliberate practice that again and again ends up explaining excellence."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1024","","“Most individuals who start as active professionals… change their behavior and increase their performance for a limited time until they reach an acceptable level."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1026","","if you just show up and work hard, you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1029","","most types of work—that is, work that doesn’t have a clear training philosophy—most people are stuck."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1031","","If you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value, as you’ll likely be alone in your dedication to systematically getting better."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1032","","That is, deliberate practice might provide the key to quickly becoming so good they can’t ignore you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1041","","“It’s like a sport, you have to practice and you have to study.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1043","","“It’s a constant learning process,”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1044","","“You need to be constantly soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals,”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1048","","“When I look back now, I’m humiliated that I ever showed it to anyone,” Alex recalled. But it was necessary if he was going to get better. “I hope I can look back ten years later and say the same about what I’m writing now.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1051","","He stretched his abilities by taking on projects that were beyond his current comfort zone;"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1101","","Step 1: Decide What Capital Market You’re In"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1103","","There are two types of these markets: winner-take-all and auction."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1104","","In a winner-take-all market, there is only one type of career capital available, and lots of different people competing for it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1106","","An auction market, by contrast, is less structured: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate a unique collection."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1115","","If you want a career in television writing, as Alex discovered, only one thing matters: the quality of your scripts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1126","","The problem, however, is that blogging in the advice space—where his site existed—is not an auction market, it’s winner-take-all. The only capital that matters is whether or not your posts compel the reader."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1128","","Some top blogs in this space have notoriously clunky designs, but they all accomplish the same baseline goal: They inspire their readers."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1133","","Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1134","","If you’re in a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: By definition, there’s only one type of capital that matters."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1135","","For an auction market, however, you have flexibility. A useful heuristic in this situation is to seek open gates—opportunities to build capital that are already open to you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1141","","The advantage of open gates is that they get you farther faster, in terms of career capital acquisition, than starting from scratch."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1143","","it’s hard to start from scratch in a new field."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1146","","Step 3: Define “Good”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1146","","once you’ve identified exactly what skill to build, that you can, for guidance, begin to draw from the research on deliberate practice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1148","","you need clear goals. If you don’t know where you’re trying to get to, then it’s hard to take effective action."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1150","","Deliberate practice] requires good goals.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1156","","Step 4: Stretch and Destroy"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1158","","Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands…. Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it “deliberate,” as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1162","","The good news about deliberate practice is that it will push you past this plateau and into a realm where you have little competition."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1163","","The bad news is that the reason so few people accomplish this feat is exactly because of the trait Colvin warned us about: Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1164","","I like the term “stretch” for describing what deliberate practice feels like,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1169","","If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably stuck at an “acceptable level.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1170","","Pushing past what’s comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate-practice story; the other part is embracing honest feedback—even if it destroys what you thought was good."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1180","","Steve Martin explained his strategy for learning the banjo: “[I thought], if I stay with it, then one day I will have been playing for forty years, and anyone who sticks with something for forty years will be pretty good at it.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1210","","RULE #3   Turn Down a Promotion"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1270","","You have to get good before you can expect good work."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1291","","The appeal of control, however, is not limited to farmers. Decades of scientific research have identified this trait as one of the most important you can pursue in the quest for a happier, more successful, and more meaningful life."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1294","","As Pink summarizes the literature, more control leads to better grades, better sports performance, better productivity, and more happiness."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1311","","Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1317","","To summarize, if your goal is to love what you do, your first step is to acquire career capital. Your next step is to invest this capital in the traits that define great work. Control is one of the most important targets you can choose for this investment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1350","","Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1368","","skipped over the part where they build a stable means to support their unconventional lifestyle. They assume that generating the courage to pursue control is what matters, while everything else is just a detail that is easily worked out."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1375","","enthusiasm alone is not rare and valuable and is therefore not worth much in terms of career capital."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1500","","The key, it seems, is to know when the time is right to become courageous in your career decisions. Get this timing right, and a fantastic working life awaits you, but get it wrong by tripping the first control trap in a premature bid for autonomy, and disaster lurks. The fault of the courage culture, therefore, is not its underlying message that courage is good, but its severe underestimation of the complexity involved in deploying this boldness in a useful way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1553","","Derek thought for a moment."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1553","","“I have this principle about money that overrides my other life rules,” he said. “Do what people are willing to pay for.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1556","","“Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you’re aiming to be valuable.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1559","","“If you’re struggling to raise money for an idea, or are thinking that you will support your idea with unrelated work, then you need to rethink the idea.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1569","","The Law of Financial Viability When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1616","","Unless people are willing to pay you, it’s not an idea you’re ready to go after."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1617","","RULE #4   Think Small, Act Big"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1650","","her happiness comes from the fact that she built her career on a clear and compelling mission—"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1652","","Her goal, put simply, is to rid the world of its most ancient and deadly diseases."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1688","","How do you make mission a reality in your working life?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1723","","just because you really want to organize your work around a mission doesn’t mean that you can easily make it happen."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1761","","We like to think of innovation as striking us in a stunning eureka moment, where you all at once change the way people see the world, leaping far ahead of our current understanding. I’m arguing that in reality, innovation is more systematic. We grind away to expand the cutting edge, opening up new problems in the adjacent possible to tackle and therefore expand the cutting edge some more, opening up more new problems,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1768","","Scientific breakthroughs, as we just learned, require that you first get to the cutting edge of your field. Only then can you see the adjacent possible beyond, the space where innovative ideas are almost always discovered."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1771","","A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1772","","If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge—the only place where these missions become visible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1775","","as a new graduate student, she was much too far from the cutting edge to have any hope of surveying the adjacent possible, and if she can’t see the adjacent possible, she’s not likely to identify a compelling new direction for her work."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1777","","Sarah would have been better served by first mastering a promising niche—a task that may take years—and only then turning her attention to seeking a mission."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1793","","If you want a mission, you need to first acquire capital."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1834","","Advancing to the cutting edge in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time. Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1855","","had notebooks filled with potential missions, yet I had resisted devoting myself to any one in particular."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1963","","“Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance,” he writes, “they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins” [emphasis mine]. This rapid and frequent feedback, Sims argues, “allows them to find unexpected avenues and arrive at extraordinary outcomes.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1974","","The important thing about little bets is that they’re bite-sized. You try one. It takes a few months at most. It either succeeds or fails, but either way you get important feedback to guide your next steps."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1990","","To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1992","","These bets allow you to tentatively explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2057","","“You’re either remarkable or invisible,” says Seth Godin in his 2002 bestseller, Purple Cow."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2058","","“The world is full of boring stuff—brown cows—which is why so few people pay attention…. A purple cow… now that would stand out. Remarkable marketing is the art of building things worth noticing.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2060","","For his mission to build a sustainable career, it had to produce purple cows, the type of remarkable projects that compel people to spread the word."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2062","","In the world of computer programming, where does one launch remarkable projects?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2065","","Featured among Fowler’s fifty-two strategies is the idea that the job seeker should leverage the open-source software movement."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2069","","Giles told me. “The synthesis of Purple Cow and My Job Went to India is that the best way to market yourself as a programmer is to create remarkable open-source software. So I did.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2077","","“I basically took Chad Fowler’s advice way too far and went to speak at almost every user group and conference that I could—at"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2082","","a good mission-driven project must be remarkable in two different ways."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2083","","First, it should be remarkable in the literal sense of compelling people to remark about it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2093","","There’s also, however, a second type of remarkability at play. Giles didn’t just find a project that compels remarks, but he also spread the word about the project in a venue that supports these remarks."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2095","","In his case, this venue was the open-source software community."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2096","","Without this conduciveness to chatter, a purple cow, though striking, may never be seen."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2100","","I realized early on in my process that blogging was a remarkable venue for introducing my ideas. Blogs are visible and the infrastructure is in place for good ideas to quickly spread,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2107","","The Law of Remarkability For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2273","","I decided that focusing my attention on a bottom-up understanding of my own field’s most difficult results would be a good first step toward revitalizing my career capital stores."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2279","","I faced immediate internal resistance."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2281","","To combat this resistance, I deployed two types of structure."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2282","","The first type was time structure: “I am going to work on this for one hour,” I would tell myself. “I don’t care if I faint from the effort, or make no progress, for the next hour this is my whole world.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2285","","The second type of structure I deployed was information structure—a way of capturing the results of my hard focus in a useful form."

If so, continue. If not, move on.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2388","","they were willing to pay me well for this move toward autonomy,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2434","","This background-research process, which combines exposure to potentially relevant material with free-form re-combination of ideas, comes straight out of Steven Johnson’s book, Where Good Ideas Come From,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2437","","According to Johnson, access to new ideas and to the “liquid networks” that facilitate their mixing and matching often provides the catalyst for breakthrough new ideas."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2442","","a little bet, in the setting of mission exploration, has the following characteristics:"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2443","","It’s a project small enough to be completed in less than a month."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2444","","It forces you to create new value (e.g., master a new skill and produce new results that didn’t exist before)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2445","","It produces a concrete result that you can use to gather concrete feedback."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2451","","When a little bet finishes, I use the concrete feedback it generates to guide my research efforts going forward. This feedback tells me, for example, whether a given project should be aborted and, if not, what direction is most promising to explore next."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2455","","In other words, the system as a whole is a closed feedback loop—constantly evolving toward a clearer and better supported vision for my work."
